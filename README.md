Songs tagging system.

Overview
--------

HarmoniTag is a system for tagging songs using their chord progression. HarmoniTag
consists of a tagged songs database, and a machine learning code to generate important
chord progressions for tagging, and later use them to make an algorithm for automatically
tagging songs. HarmoniTag encourages you to improve database/code in order to get even
better result. HarmoniTag can be used for many applications like songs recommendation,
and is using chord progression to generate tags, which makes it faster then DSP, and
more reliable then croud-sourcing.
